*Technologies*
●   The development will have to be in CSS, without JavaScript.
●   No framework should be used; however, Sass would be a plus.
●   No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag."


*Compatibility*
As the target market is the connected and hurried population, the site will be developed
using the mobile-first approach. For this reason, only mobile models will be made.
On tablet and desktop, the site will have to adapt, but these formats are not a priority, so
the developer defines the layout.
● The whole site will have to be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
● The pages will have to pass W3C validation in HTML and CSS without errors.
● The site must be fully compatible with the latest desktop versions of Chrome,
Firefox, and Safari.


*Graphic Effects and Animations*
The effects accessible by clicking or hovering are visible on the model. They must use CSS animations or transitions, no JavaScript, or library.

"Buttons
●    When hovering, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The drop shadow should also be more visible.
●    Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For that, a heart-shaped Like button is present on the model. When you click on it, it should fill up gradually. For this first version, the effect can appear on hovering instead of clicking.
Home Page
●    When the application has more menus, a loading spinner will be necessary. On this mock-up, we would like to have a preview of it. It will have to appear for 1 to 3 seconds when you arrive on the home page, cover the whole screen, and use CSS animations (no library). The design of this loader is not defined, so any proposal is welcome as long as it is consistent with the graphic charter.
Menu Pages
●    When arriving on the page, the dishes should appear gradually with a slight time lag. They may appear either one by one or by group Starter, Main course, and Dessert. An example of the expected effect is provided.
●    The visitor can add the dishes he wishes to his order by clicking on them. A small checkmark will appear to the right of the dish. This tick should slide from right to left. For this first version, the effect can be displayed on hovering instead of clicking. If the title of the dish is too long, it will have to be trimmed with suspension points. An
example of the expected effect is provided."
